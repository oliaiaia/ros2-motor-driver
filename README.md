# ros2-motor-driver
Create ros2 motor driver node for raspi 4 using libgpiod

The large project is dedicated to the creation of a small autonomous car on omnidirectional wheels. This repository contains the code
to control 4 L298N drivers. Raspberry 4 was selected as the microcomputer. The driver node was written in C++.


Further plans for the development of the project:
1. Improve custom messages
2. Add the ability to adjust the speed of motors using a PWM signal using PCA9685.
